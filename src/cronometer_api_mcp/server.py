    Prefer relative inputs for relative questions, rather than dates calculated
    from conversation history. For calorie/nutrient totals without individual

    Returns every food entry logged for the day. Each "Serving" entry is
    enriched (best-effort) with the food's name, source, the serving measure
    (unit name and grams per unit), the number of servings, and that food's
    own nutrient profile scaled to the amount eaten. Non-food entries
    (exercise, biometrics) carry their own name.

    Note: the per-entry "nutrients" are each food's individual contribution,
    which is distinct from the day-level nutrition_summary aggregate below.

    Also returns a top-level energy_summary field with pre-computed
    values most relevant to the user:

      - total_target_kcal: daily calorie target dynamically adjusted
        for expenditure and weight goal (equivalent to Cronometer's
        "Total Target" in the Energy Summary screen)

      - remaining_kcal: calories remaining to stay on target
        (total_target_kcal - consumed_kcal). Always report this
        when summarizing the user's day. Prefer this over manually
        deriving values from the burn breakdown fields.

    Also returns a nutrition_summary field with consumed totals for every
    nutrient the user tracks in Cronometer (macros plus any tracked
    micronutrients such as saturated fat, cholesterol, or omega-3/6):

      - macros: flat macro totals (energy, protein, carbs, net_carbs, fat,
        fiber, alcohol)
